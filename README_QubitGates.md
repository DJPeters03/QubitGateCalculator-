# Qubit Gate Demo â€” Two Spheres

This project visualizes the action of **single- and two-qubit gates** on qubit states using **Bloch spheres**.

### Features
- Apply single-qubit gates (X, Y, Z, H, S, T, Rx, Ry, Rz).
- Apply two-qubit entangling gates (CNOT, CZ, SWAP).
- Measure qubits in the computational basis.
- Real-time Bloch sphere visualization for two qubits.

### Skills Demonstrated
- Complex number arithmetic and linear algebra in JavaScript.
- Quantum gate implementation and visualization.
- User interface for interactive gate selection.

### Run Instructions
Open `QuantumSphereCalculator.html` in a browser.  
Use the control panel to apply gates and observe entanglement.
